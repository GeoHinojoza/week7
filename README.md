Evaluating data, GitHub Pages, and telling stories with maps

## Intro to GitHub Pages

## Story Mapping: *because no one has thought of a narrative approach to mapping until now apparently?*

In the last several years, story mapping has emerged as a way to bring a "guided tour" feel to interactive maps. Below are (in my mind at least) the biggest players.

### Esri's approach
https://storymaps.arcgis.com
https://esri.github.io/#Storytelling
[example](http://storymaps.esri.com/stories/2015/refugee-crisis/)

##### Pros
- Esri integration
- Easy to include photos/videos from other website
- Ease of use

##### Cons
- Can be a little on the ugly side
- Limited to Esri map embedding

### Odyssey.js (from CartoDB team)
http://umn-gis-5574.github.io/odyssey.js/
http://www.azavea.com/blogs/atlas/2015/02/using-odysseyjs-sandbox/
[example](http://clhenrick.github.io/BushwickCommunityMap/)

##### Pros
- Very powerful
- Integrates Torque as a unique viewing option
- Easy to connect to a CartoDB layer

##### Cons
- Documentation is a bit spotty, making the learning curve a bit trickier than the others
- Looking forward, it's not clear if it's going to see much improvement 

##### Other
- Great way to start writing in Markdown, as it's an integral aspect of Odyssey

### StoryMapJS from Knight Lab
https://storymap.knightlab.com/
[example](http://www.minnpost.com/stroll/2014/06/hockey-hip-hop-and-other-green-line-highlights)
